    <p>I was responsible for the detailed design of the foundations and steel framing for this restaurant addition. This project had unique complexities including a cantilevered exterior feature stair; a retractable glass roof which required very high deflection tolerances of the supporting steel framing; and large openings in the roof diaphragms which required horizontal trusses to direct load to the diagonal braces.</p>
