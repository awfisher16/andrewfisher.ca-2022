    <p>I was responsible for the detailed design of the foundations, shear walls, and steel framing for the Phase 3 Student Union Building. This project had unique complexities including a one storey Vierendeel truss to transfer 4 storeys over the ground floor atrium; the utilization of Deltabeams for the floor system; supporting a PV solar array system  on the roof; and designing NLT canopies for the building entrances.</p>
