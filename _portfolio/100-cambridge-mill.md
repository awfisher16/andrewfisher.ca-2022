<div id="content">
    <p>As the lead engineer for the Cambridge Mill project, I was responsible for coordinating the preliminary structural design with the architect and performing preliminary structural design checks. I created the ETABS analysis model for sizing the structural elements and worked through preliminary sizing of transfer elements at the feature "belt-line" and at the ground floor cutbacks at the base of the towers.</p>
